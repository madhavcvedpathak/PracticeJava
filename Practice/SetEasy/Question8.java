// An international round table conference will be held in india.
// Presidents from all over the world representing their respective countries
// will be attending the conference. The task is to find the possible number
// of ways(P) to make the N members sit around the circular table such that.
//
//The president and prime minister of India will always sit next to each other.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input :
//
//4   -> Value of N(No. of members)
//
//Output :
//
//12  -> Possible ways of seating the members
//
//Explanation:
//
//2  members should always be next to each other.
//
//So, 2 members can be in 2!ways
//
//Rest of the members can be arranged in (4-1)! ways.(1 is subtracted because the previously selected two members will be considered as single members now).
//
//So total possible ways 4 members can be seated around the circular table 2*6= 12.
//
//Hence, output is 12.
