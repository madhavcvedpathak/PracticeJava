//Example
//Input : 6 28
//Output : Yes, they are a friendly pair
//Explanation : The factors of 6 and 28 except the numbers themselves are 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 respectively.
//Now the sum of factors of both the numbers are 6 and 28 respectively.
//When we divide the sums with the numbers we get 1 and 1 respectively.
//As the ratio of both the number match, they are considered as a friendly pair.
